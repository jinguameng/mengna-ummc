## <span style="color:red">Question 1</span>

<span style="color:orange">Following is a sample of 1,000 gametes produced by a trihybrid individual. Please answer the following questions. Label each gamete (or haplotype) as non-recombinant, single recombinant or double recombinant.  (Score 15)</span>

![](hw6q1.PNG)


Recombinant probability $\theta$ has to be $\leq 0.5$ and non-recombinat probability has to be $\geq 0.5$. There are 1000 gametes and the total number of the two non-recombinant haplotypes shoule be greater or equal than 500, hence Btr|bTR should be the individual's diplotype. Below is my infer,

Haplotype | Label
------------- | -------------
BTR | single recombinant
btr | single recombinant
Btr | non-recombinant
bTR | non-recombinant
BtR | single recombinant
bTr | single recombinant
BTr | double recombinant
btR | double recombinant









## <span style="color:red">Question 2</span>

<span style="color:orange">What is the probability of following pedigree genotype? If f(D)=0.1 and genotypes for subject 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 are G1 = DD, G2 = DD, G3 = G4 = G5 = Dd? (Score 15)</span>

![](hw6q2.PNG)

$Pr(D) = 0.1 => Pr(d) = 0.9$  

$Pr(DD) = 0.01, Pr(Dd) = 0.18, Pr(dd) = 0.81$

$Pr(G1, G2, G3, G4, G5)$  

$= Pr(G1)Pr(G2)Pr(G3 | G1, G2)Pr(G4)Pr(G5|G3, G4)$

Because there is no way $G3$ can be Dd given her parents don't contain d in there genotype, $Pr(G3 | G1, G2) = 0$.  

Hence,  

$Pr(G1, G2, G3, G4, G5) = 0$  








## <span style="color:red">Question 3</span>
<span style="color:orange">Suppose an autosome locus has alleles of D and d with f(D)=0.1 and penetrance, Pr(Y = 1|G1 = DD) = 0.8, Pr(Y = 1|G1 = Dd) = 0.4, and Pr(Y = 1|G1 = dd) = 0.2. We collected a sample as following and all individuals have genotypes of Dd. What is the sample’s joint probability Pr(Y1, Y2, Y3, Y4, Y5, G1, G2, G3, G4, G5)? (Score 15)</span>

$Pr(Y=1 | G1 = DD = 0.8) => Pr(Y=0 | G1 = DD = 0.2)$  

$Pr(Y=1 | G1 = Dd = 0.4) => Pr(Y=0 | G1 = Dd = 0.6)$

We don't know the sample's genotypes and all of them are independent, so, when calculating the joint probability we can just ignore their genotypes.  

$Pr(Y1, Y2, Y3, Y4, Y5, G1, G2, G3, G4, G5)$

$Pr(Y=1 | G1 = dd = 1) =>Pr(Y=0 | G1 = DD = 0)$ 

Based on the penetrances, we can conclude that people who has been affected have only one possiable genotype: dd. So, individual 2, individual 3 and individual 5 have genotype dd.  

Because invidual 3's genotype(dd) is inherited from individual 2(dd) and individual 1(?). And for people who are not affected there are two possiable genotypes: DD and Dd, and individual 1's genotype can only be Dd.  

So till now, there is only one individual's genotype is unknown - individual 4. Due to 4 has not been affected, we will consider two genotypes for him(DD and Dd) when calculating the joint probability.
