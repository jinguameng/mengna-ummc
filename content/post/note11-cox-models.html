<p>Cox Models = Propotional Hazards Models</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Survival analysis methods, such as proportional hazards regression differ from logistic regression by assessing a rate instead of a proportion.</p></li>
<li><p>Proportional hazards regression, also called Cox regression, <span style="color:orange">models the incidence or hazard rate, the number of new cases of disease per population at-risk per unit time.</span> If the outcome is death, this is the mortality rate.</p></li>
<li><p>The hazard function is the probability that if a person survives to t, they will experience the event in the next instant.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\lambda (t|X_{1i}, X_{2i}, ..., X_{ki}) = \lambda _0 (t)exp(\beta_1X_{1i} + \beta_2X_{2i} + ... +\beta_kX_{ki})\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(log(\frac{\lambda (t|X_{1i}, X_{2i}, ..., X_{ki})}{\lambda _0 (t)}) = exp(\beta_1X_{1i} + \beta_2X_{2i} + ... +\beta_kX_{ki})\)</span></p>
<ul>
<li><p><span style="color:orange"><span class="math inline">\(\lambda (t|X_{1i}, X_{2i}, ..., X_{ki}):\)</span></span> this is the the hazard function for the ith person at time t,i=1,2,⋯,n.</p></li>
<li><p><span style="color:orange"><span class="math inline">\(\lambda _0 (t):\)</span></span> this is the baseline hazard function at time t, which is analogous to the intercept term in a multiple regression or logistic regression model. And it is unknown.</p></li>
<li><p><span style="color:orange"><span class="math inline">\(log(\frac{\lambda (t|X_{1i}, X_{2i}, ..., X_{ki})}{\lambda _0 (t)}):\)</span></span> this is the log of hazard ratio. The ratio of hazard functions can be considered a ratio of risk functions.</p></li>
<li><p>There is no particular probability model selected to represent the survival times.</p></li>
<li><p>But there is a big <span style="color:orange">assumption</span>: the hazard for any individual is a fixed proportion of the hazard for any other individual. (i.e., proportional hazards). Notice if <span class="math inline">\(λ_0(t)\)</span> is the hazard function for a subject with all the predictor values equal to zero and <span class="math inline">\(λ_1(t)\)</span> is the hazard function for a subject with other values for the predictor variables, then the hazard ratio depends only on the predictor variables and not on time t. This assumption means if a covariate doubles the risk of the event on day one, it also doubles the risk of the event on any other day.</p></li>

<li><p><span style="color:green">Hazard Ratio</span>: similar with odds ratio.</p></li>
