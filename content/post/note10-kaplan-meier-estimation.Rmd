## <span style="color:red"> Understanding K-M Curve </span> 

- the K-M survival curve is defined as the probability of surviving in a given length of time while considering time in many small intervals.  

- interval: the horizontal line in K-M graph.  
serial time duration contains two types of duration:  
1. known survival(event occured)  
2. unknown survival(censored)  
and only 1 are called interval in K-M graph, 2 are indicated on K-M curve as tick marks.  

- vertical distance between horizontals: illustrate the change in cumulative survival probablity as the curve advances.  

- K-M curve are not smooth function, but rather step-wise estimates.  

- In K-M curve, the Y axis stands for cumulative surviving probability.  

- cumulative surviving prob = $\Pi (interval survival rate)$, each horizontal line as an interval survival rate,  
interval survival rate = $\frac{total-number-of-current-alive-people}{total-number-of-alive-people- in-previous-horizontal-line-excluding-censored-people}$  

- censoring has an effect on the survival rate.  

- censoring removes the subjects from the denominator.  


- K-M Estimation is a non-parametric estimation of survival function.

- when no event times are censored, a non-parametric estimator of S(T) is $1-F_{n}(t)$, where $F_{n}(t)$ is the empirical cumulative distribution function.  

- when some observations are censored, we can estimate S(t) using KM estimation.

Let: $n_i$ be number of objects at risk of dying at time $t_i$  
$d_i$ be number of events that occur at time $t_i$  

## <span style="color:red"> KM estimator </span>  
$\hat{S}(t) = \prod_{k=1}^i \frac{n_k - d_k}{n_k}$


## <span style="color:red"> Basic tests for difference in survival curves

Want to test:  
$H_0: S_1(t) = S_2(t)$  
$H_1: S_1(t) \neq S_2(t)$

```{r}
mydat <- matrix(c('d1i','d2i','n1i-d1i','n2i-d2i'),ncol = 2, byrow = T)
colnames(mydat) <- c('Group 1', 'Group 2')
rownames(mydat) <- c('Died','Survived')
mydat
```


Test Statistic:  
$Q = \frac{(\sum w_i (d_{1i} - \hat{e}_{1i}))^2}{\sum w_i ^2 \hat{v}_{1i}}$
where:  
$\hat{e}_{1i} = \frac{n_{1i}d_{1i}}{n_{i}}$ 

$\hat{v}_{1i} = \frac{n_{1i}n_{2i}d_i (n_i - d_i)}{n_i ^2 (n_i - 1)}$  

$w_i =$ some weighting functing

Tests:  
Log-rank: $w_i = 1$  
Wilcoxon: $w_i = n_i$  
Tarone-ware: $w_i = \sqrt{n_i}$  
Peto-Peto: $w_i = \prod_{i=1}^T (\frac{1-\hat{e}_i}{n_i + 1})$
